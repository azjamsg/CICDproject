## This is a simple implementation of a CI and CD workflow

1. User edit and works on node.js server
2. User git commits 
3. User push to this github 
4. The directory gets build into a docker container
5. Google cloud platform pulls the docker container
6. Google cloud platform runs the docker container on port 8081

The user can then see the nodejs app on port 8081 from web preview
